									<h2>Multivariate Analysis of K-Pop Audio Features</h2>
									<p> This project is the <a href="http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=bgsu1617105874719868" > masters thesis </a> I completed for my masters of applied statistics degree at BGSU. 
										The aim of this analysis was to leverage Spotify audio feature data to gain insights on 
										how to characterize the genre of K-pop and to further understand its global popularity. 
										<br />
										<br />
										To explore the popularity and identity of the genre, multivariate analysis is performed on 
										a curated dataset of 12,012 K-pop songs and their audio features. 
										The audio features, collected with Spotify's Web API and Python, include variables such as Danceability, Loudness, Acousticness, and Valence. 
										Regression models are used to examine the relationship between audio features and popularity. 
										Hypothesis testing is applied to compare audio features between different K-pop artist attributes (ex: gender, generation). 
										Finally, dimension reduction of the audio features performed by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) paired with K-means clustering are utilized 
										to explore the possibility of optimal song clusters within K-pop.
										<br />
										<br />
										Received 2nd place paper presentation award at the 2021 Charles E. Shanklin Graduate Symposium at BGSU.

									<h2>American Soldier in WWII</h2>
									<p> The project aims to analyze textual data produced as part of <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/tkotwim/the-american-soldier/about/research">American Soldier in World War II</a>, a federally funded, 
										multi-institutional digital history project devoted to raise public awareness on the experiences of World War II American GIs. 
										The project harvests data from a unique and historic collection of “attitude surveys” 
										that were administered to hundreds of thousands of American Army troops during the war in 1943. 
										The DSPG team analyzed soldiers’ handwritten responses by using, natural language processing (NLP), 
										computational text analysis and social network analysis to dive into soldiers’ attitudes about racial and ethnic relations 
										as well as gender relations. 
										<br />
										<br />
										Project methods and findings are outlined <a href = "https://dspg-young-scholars-program.github.io/dspg20amsoldier/?dspg">here</a>. 
										<br />
										<br />
										This project was federally funded by the National Endowment for the Humanitites.
										<br />
										<br />
										This is a featured project for the Data Science for Public Good program with UVA.

									<h2>Economic Mobiltiy of South Wasco</h2>
									<p> The purpose of this project was to provide community decisionmakers of South Wasco, Oregon 
										with baseline datasets and comparative analyses of the likely factors affecting economic mobility. 
										South Wasco County, Oregon, located in the state’s north central border, experienced 
										significant economic decline in the 1980s driven largely by the loss of timber industry. 
										This was followed by closure of schools and consolidation of students from school districts and 
										an out-migration of residents that disrupted economic stability, community health, and quality of life. 
										This project was completed in collaboration between Cooperative Extension, the <a href = "https://www.southwascoalliance.org/">South Wasco Alliance</a>, 
										and the University of Virginia Social Decision and Analytics department.

									<h2>Market Research of Concert Attendance at BGSU</h2>
									<p> This project investigates the factors that influence students’ decisions to attend concerts at the College of Musical Arts (CMA). 
										By methodology of survey research and statistical analysis, this project explores factors such as 
										students’ personal music background (interest and education), effectiveness of marketing, 
										personal incentive to attend concerts, and perceived level of the CMA’s engagement with the student community. 
										The results of the survey analysis provides the College of Musical Arts with 
										insights on marketing initiatives to attract the student community.
