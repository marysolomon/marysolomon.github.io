									<p> This project was completed for the master's thesis of my applied statistics degree at BGSU. 
										I curated dataset of 12,012 Korean pop songs and their audio features using Python and Spotify API. 
										Then, I applied advanced statistical methods such as regression, clustering, PCA, and hypothesis testing 
										to extract insights on how audio features define the genre of K-pop and contribute to its global popularity.

									<p> Completed with the Data Science for Public Good program, this project leverages natural language processing (NLP), 
										computational text analysis and social network analysis to glean insights into American soldiers’ attitudes about 
										racial and ethnic relations as well as gender relations during World War II. 
										The <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/tkotwim/the-american-soldier/about/research">dataset</a> 
										is sourced from a unique and historic collection of “attitude surveys” that were administered to hundreds of thousands of American Army troops during the war in 1943. 
										This project is part of the larger multi-institutional <a href = "https://americansoldierww2.org/">American Soldier in WWII</a> project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.
